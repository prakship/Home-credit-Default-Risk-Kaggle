# Home-credit-Default-Risk-Kaggle
This is a Kaggle problem which I took up so that I learn to handle 'Big Data' which is basically large amount of data. Also I learned how to join different but related data files while deriving new domain specific features.

# Introduction
In this project, we will be predicting whether or not a client will repay their loan using Home Credit’s historical loan application data, which includes a variety of telco and transactional information to predict a client’s repayment abilities. The data contains information about the loan being repaid or not and hence we have a supervised classification problem at hand.Hence, we will start by building a baseline model using a naive classification algorithm and eventually move to more sophisticated algorithms.
